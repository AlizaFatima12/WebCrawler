# WebCrawler
This project is a Python-based web crawler that fetches and extracts data from websitesâ€”including headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It supports both static and dynamic web pages using requests and Selenium. The crawler also respects robots.txt rules and stores all extracted content in a structured SQLite database
